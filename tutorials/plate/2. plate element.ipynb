    "Plates are structures with flat,noncurved surfaces whose thickness is usually is very less compared to lateral dimensions. Plates are generally subjected to transverse loading and they resist the loading by bending in both planar directions and through twisting. They can be considered the two-dimensional extension of a beam in simple bending. Plates provide axial and flexural rigidity and are used to design floor slabs, bridge decks, aircraft structures etc.. \n",
